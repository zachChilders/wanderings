AMSI Bypass Demo - ~10 minutes

Explanation of why it's impossible to fix - Massive surface area

    - Customers need features
    - Those features are not aligned with actual security

In general, software sucks - CASB

    - Processes are tied to suboptimal organizations
    - Deadlines often lead to poor quality
    - Less is more, we judge code by bugs per line
    - Customer requirements are subject to a chain of humans committing errors

Malware devs are also devs

    - Adversarial in nature, will pick your code apart
    - Same problems as network defense - one mistake blows the whole thing
    - 9 to 5 as well, they have scrum meetings at the same time I do

Shellter & polymorphic compilers

Snake Oil

    - All of the above applies to all software
    - Most security software is purely reactive
    - Stuff like splunk is basically predatory
    - ML most definitely won't save us

Light Ahead

    - CICD and good practices are becoming standard
    - #RewriteItInRust
    - Please stop writing code
